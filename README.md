# qsar_ml
ML prediction of antimicrobial peptides

This is slightly modified from: https://github.com/dataprofessor/peptide-ml

For module *lazypredict* I modied the dependency Supervised.py (it lives at C:/Users/Windows/anaconda3/lib/site-packages/lazypredict after pip install lazypredict on my PC)- see inside for comments

Start with set_up.bash  - it's a bash equivalent of the MAgic commands on the original repo

Then use qsar_ml1.py then qsar_ml2.py
