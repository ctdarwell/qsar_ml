# qsar_ml
ML prediction of antimicrobial peptides

This is modified from: https://github.com/dataprofessor/peptide-ml

For module *lazypredict* I modified the dependency `Supervised.py` (found at "**C:/Users/Windows/anaconda3/lib/site-packages/lazypredict**" after `pip install lazypredict` thru conda on my PC due to some odd, presumably due to deprecation, behaviours) - see inside file for comments

Start in a Linux terminal with `set_up.bash`  - it's a bash equivalent of the Magic commands on the original repo

Then use `qsar_ml1.py` then `qsar_ml2.py`
